##The long-term goals of our research are: 


###1) to develop germplasm with improved tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses  


###2) to generate genetic and genomic resources for taking forward wheat research




###The Li lab at SDState is focused on understanding genetics, genomics and evolution of wheat and its relatives and utilize the knowledge for germplasm enhancement:




###_CRISPR-based genome editing of grain size regulators for novel variation to increase wheat genetic yield potential_ [more](/grainsize_project/)





###_Dissecting the sea wheatgrass genome to transfer biotic stress resistance and abiotic stress tolerance into wheat_ [more](/swg/)





###_Root Development and VSR_





###_Understanding cuticular wax biosynthesis in wheat and its role in drought tolerance_





###_speciation of diploid and polyploid wheat and relative species and role of chromosome rearrangements_

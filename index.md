# Welcome to the Li Lab!

We are part of the [Department of Biology and Microbiology](https://www.sdstate.edu/biology-and-microbiology)and the [Deptartment of Agronomy, Horticulture and Plant Science](https://www.sdstate.edu/agronomy-horticulture-plant-science). 

Research in Li Lab focuses on genetics, genomics, germplasm enhancement and evolution of wheat and its relatives. We are studying genetics of agriculturally important traits using genome mapping, map-based cloning, transcriptomics, metabolics and reverse genetics approaches such as allele mining and genome editing. The traits under investigations range from grain size, biotic stress resistance, abiotic tolerance to root development. We are developing novel germplasm using inter-specific hybridization-based and genome-editing approaches. We are analyzing phylogeny of polyploid wheats using a chloroplast-based whole genome approach and studying the role of chromosome rearrangements in speciation of diploid and polyploid wheat and relative species.

We are located in McFadden Biostress Laboratories Building at the Brookings Main Campus of [South Dakota State University](https://www.sdstate.edu).
